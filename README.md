# User Centric Frontend Development Milestone Project

This is my portfolio website to present my current knowladge. This is my first website that cover HTML5, CSS3 and bootstrap, as well as including a bit about myself, my coding skills, and a contact form. 

## UX
My goal in the design was to make it as easy as possible to access information on the site, while striving for a minimalist design.

## Demo
A live demo can be found [here](https://kraljiccar.github.io/User-Centric-Frontend-Development-Milestone-Project/).

## Technologies
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. Bootstrap (4.7.0)


## Features
This site uses the scrollSpy feature in Bootstrap. The navbar becomes collapsed only on small screens.


## Testing
This site was tested across multiple browsers and on multiple mobile devices to ensure compatibility and responsiveness.


## Deployment 
This site is hosted using GitHub pages, deployed directly from the master branch. The live site updates automatically each time there is a new push to the repository. You can `git clone` the code to run it locally on your machine.
